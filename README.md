# HSK1_trainer

This python code will help you to learn Chinese characters.

You can write the characters you want to learn in dedicated list in the code, then, you just have to run the code and learn.

For each word of the list, the program will take randomly a word and a language (french/english, chineese, pinyin) so you have to translate it to train your skills.

When you wrote your word, you can ask to the program for checking the correct answer, then you have to tell it if your answer were good or not because the program will save all your trainings, scores etc. in json file.

# Potential Upgrades:
- add voice to train our ears to listen spoken chineese characters
- propose to the user some graphs with its evolution across time
